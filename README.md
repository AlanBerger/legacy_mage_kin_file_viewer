# legacy_mage_kin_file_viewer
legacy mage molecular graphics viewer for Windows from the Richardson Lab at Duke University displays kin files 


mage5.81.010509.win_RichardsonLab.exe  is an old (2001) version (for Windows computers) 
of the Mage molecular graphics software that displays .kin files that was freely available 
from the Jane Richardson and David Richardson Lab in the Biochemistry Department
at Duke University 

This executable needs no other software installed and is easy to use on Windows computers, at least for older
type .kin (kinetic image) files.

I couldn't find this version of mage on the web (the original Richardson web page is no longer
operational). There are newer versions - search on: KiNG (Kinemage Next Generation),
or see   https://github.com/rlabduke/mage   or     http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/

I have placed this old version of mage here to have it available for anyone who wants to use this 
version of mage.
